The safeguarding of sensitive data is becoming more and more important as the digital world changes. 
In our project **CipherVault**, we implement the **TwoFish algorithm** in Python to create a secure file management application.

**I. Description**  

Python, with its extensive collection of modules makes it an apt choice for our project.  

Modules used:   

|FUNCTION                  | MODULES USED
|:-------------------------| :----------------
|GUI 	                     | Tkinter, easygui    |
|File Handling	            | Os, shutil          |
|Cryptography	            | Twofish             |
|System Operations	      | Subprocess, psutil  |
|Time Operations	         | Time, datetime      |
|Database Connectivity	   | mysql,connector     |
|Emails	                  | smtplib             |
|OTP & 2FA	               | pyotp               |

Database used to store passwords: MySQL  
A database **FileExplorer** is created to store static data received upon initialising the application- the Passwords and Access Time.

**III. HOW TO INITIALISE AND RUN THE APPLICATION LOCALLY ON YOUR DEVICE**  
1. Download the CipherVault_Code.py file and run it.
2. Set up the initial requirements- passwords and access time
3. You are now ready to use it :)
